#.zshrc-and-.bashrc Repository

This repository contains configuration files for my shell environments. I primarily use Git Bash to run a Zsh shell on Windows.
## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to store and manage my Zsh and Bash configurations so that I can easily set up new environments or recover existing ones.
